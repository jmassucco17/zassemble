========================================

    The instruction set for the student-created single-cycle
CPU is a subset of the MIPS instruction set.  It is comprised
of physical instructions and pseudoinstructions.  Since the
student CPU is simple, only 11 physical instructions have
been implemented.  To complement this limited instruction
set, 9 pseudoinstructions have been added.

========================================
=     II. Implementation Overview      =
========================================

    The assembler consists of two main steps, the first
of which is much more significant than the second.
    In the first step, the assembler proceeds line-by-line
through the input file and parses for labels and
instructions. Labels and instructions are organized
in linked list with relevant data.
    In the second step, the assembler begins writing 
instructions to the output file and, if it finds an 
branch/jump instructions, attempts to link them to
the labels they reference. At the end of this step,
the assembler handles all errors. If there were any 
errors, the output file is deleted, just as it would
be in compilers like GCC.

-

i. Preprocessor

    On the first pass of the user file, lines are
extracted from the file and strtok (from string.h) is
used to separate it into its tokens.  Decision making
is performed based on whether or not a label exists,
and on the opcode.

a. Label Collection

    The label is identified by splitting on the ':'
character.  If no : character exists in the line, this
step is skipped; the token pointer points to the opcode.

    Labels are stored in a linked list so that memory
management is not a concern.  When a label is encountered,
the label identifier is prepended to the linked list along
with the current line number.

    If a label was found, strtok is reset so that the 
token points to the opcode. The label is also stripped from the line in memory.

b. Instruction Datatype

    There are three types of physical instructions - I-, J- and
R-type instructions.  I-type instructions accept an constant
value (or immediate value), declared at assemble time.  J-type
instructions take an address in the immediate space and may
change the program counter to this address's value.  Finally,
R-type instructions are performed entirely within the register
space and take two input registers and a destination register.

    The base opcode is stored in a struct called
INSTR, which allows a polymorphic approach to
populating the fixed-width instruction with different
arguments.

   typedef struct INSTR_
    {
        unsigned short          : 12;
        unsigned short opcode   :  4;
    } INSTR;

    If the opcode is associated with an R-type
instruction, the struct is cast to an R_INSTR type.  This
type has fields for an opcode, three registers and pads to account for
the extra 4 bits at the end of the instruction.

    typedef struct R_INSTR_
    {
        unsigned short          : 6;
        unsigned short rd       : 2;
        unsigned short rt       : 2;
        unsigned short rs       : 2;
        unsigned short opcode   : 4;
    } R_INSTR;

    If the opcode is instead associated with an I- or
J-type instruction, the struct is cast to the IJ_INSTR type.
This type has fields for an opcode, two registers, and 16 bits
of instruction data.

    typedef struct IJ_INSTR_
    {
        unsigned short immed    : 8;
        unsigned short rd       : 2;
        unsigned short rs       : 2;
        unsigned short opcode   : 4;
    } IJ_INSTR;

    The appropriate struct is populated using strtok and
scanf to extract each token, then the correct register number
from the token, where appropriate.

c. Pseudoinstruction Expansion

    The token is known at this stage to point to the opcode.
The opcode is checked against all the implemented
pseudoinstructions.  If a pseudoinstruction's opcode is
encountered, the arguments are parsed out using strtok and
the expanded instructions are added to a linked list containing
the INSTR structs. The line number counter is incremented by 
the number of lines in the expanded instruction.

    If the opcode is not that of a pseudoinstruction, the
line is converted to an INSTR struct and added to the linked
list containing the converted program. If the instruction is a
beq to a label, the label is added to the linked list node and
the INSTR.immed field is populated with a placeholder value of -1.

d. Type Determination and Serialization

    In order to make the second pass over the instructions as
simple as possible, a linked list is formed with the INSTR_LIST
struct as the node object.  This struct holds an INSTR pointer
and a char* to hold labels that have not been translated yet
in addition to the next pointer.

    The opcode is extracted first.  It is compared to each
known physical instruction  in order to assign the actual
opcode into the instruction data type.  At this stage, if
the first token in the line is not an instruction, an error
will be returned.

    Now that the integer opcode is known, the code can
quickly determine whether the instruction is R- or I/J-type.
The appropriate instruction datatype is created and the rest
of the instruction is tokenized and parsed in order to populate
accordingly.  In the event of a BEQ instruction pointing to a
label, the INSTR_LIST.label field is filled with the label and
the IJ_INSTR.immed value is set to -1.

-

ii. Assembler

    The assembler step is a simple pass over the linked list of
mostly-populated instructions, writing them to the output binary
and populating labels where necessary from the label linked list.
If the operation is a BEQ or BNE, then the label in the node is
used to look up the correct immediate value.

a. Binary File Population

    The line's machine code translation is now present in
the INSTR struct, having been populated based on its type.
It can now be written to the output file, which has been
opened in write mode.  This file can now be loaded
into the student CPU's instruction memory for execution.

-

iii. Future Work

a. Platform Independence Concerns

    The implementation as it stands is platform-dependent. The
use of bitfielded structs is frowned upon for platform-independent
low-level code, since it is largely compiler-dictated and the
endianness and instruction order is not part of the C standard.  
Additionally, the endianness of the raw struct data may need to be
swapped depending on the byte endianness of the target processor.
These changes should be straightforward and should be made using
preprocessor defines to the C compiler so that the correct
endianness can be chosen at compile time.

========================================

-

i. Using ZAssemble

The assembler is called ZAssemble and can be used as follows:

zassemble INPUT_FILE [OUTPUT_FILE]

The INPUT_FILE must be a text file written in assembly
and with labels on the same line as the addressed instruction.
Blank lines are allowed.  The output file is a binary
which should be loaded into the student CPU's instruction memory.

-

ii. Compiling ZAssemble

This assembler was compiled with GCC 4.8.1 using the following flags:

gcc [-g] -o zassemble zassemble.c

bit_clear: sll $2, $2, 1
           slr $3, $3, 1
           beq $3, $0, done
           j mult_loop
done:      lw $0, $1, 0x10
